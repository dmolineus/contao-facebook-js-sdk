Contao Facebook JavaScript SDK
=====================

Automatically integrates the Facebook JavaScript SDK in the Contao front end or back end.

Since version `3.0.0` you can define the Facebook App ID and Secret per website root in order to be able to use different Facebook Apps for different domains. The Facebook JavaScript SDK also will not be added automatically to the front end anymore - you have to enable this in the website root settings also.
